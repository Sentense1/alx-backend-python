Unit Tests:

Scope: Unit tests are focused on individual components or units of code, such as functions, methods, or classes. They aim to verify that these units work as intended in isolation.

Dependencies: Unit tests isolate the code under test from external dependencies, using techniques like mocking or stubbing to replace dependencies with controlled, predictable behavior. This allows you to test the unit's functionality independently.

Purpose: The primary purpose of unit tests is to catch bugs and ensure that small, isolated parts of your codebase are working correctly. Unit tests are especially valuable during development as they provide rapid feedback to developers.

Isolation: Unit tests are isolated from other parts of the application. They are not concerned with how the unit interacts with other components, only with its own internal logic and behavior.

Speed: Unit tests are typically fast to execute because they focus on small, isolated components. Developers can run them frequently during development to maintain code quality.

Examples: Testing a specific function, method, or class without considering its interactions with other parts of the system. For example, testing a sorting algorithm, a mathematical function, or a parser.

Integration Tests:

Scope: Integration tests focus on the interactions and collaborations between different components or units of an application. They verify that these components work correctly when integrated into a complete system.

Dependencies: Integration tests typically involve real or mock external dependencies, such as databases, APIs, and services. They aim to ensure that all parts of the system interact correctly.

Purpose: The primary purpose of integration tests is to detect issues related to the interaction and integration of components. These tests help uncover problems that unit tests might miss, such as configuration errors or communication problems.

Interaction: Integration tests assess how different parts of the system interact with each other. They cover the flow of data, information, and control between various components, including external systems.

Speed: Integration tests can be slower to execute compared to unit tests, as they involve multiple components and real-world interactions. They are usually run less frequently, often as part of the build and deployment process.

Examples: Testing an entire application or a significant portion of it, including interactions with databases, external services, and APIs. For instance, testing an e-commerce application's ordering process, where user input, database operations, and external payment gateways are involved.

In summary, unit tests focus on the correctness of isolated components, while integration tests ensure that these components work together as expected in a complete system. Both types of tests are essential for a comprehensive testing strategy, as they address different aspects of software quality and reliability.
